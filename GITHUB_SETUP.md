git commit -m "Initial commit: BC Commercial Solar Platform"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

After uploading, your repository should show:
- ✅ Professional README with project overview
- ✅ Complete source code (client, server, shared)
- ✅ Configuration files
- ✅ Documentation (README, DEPLOYMENT guide)
- ✅ License file
- ✅ Environment template

## Step 4: Set Repository Settings

1. Go to your repository settings (Settings tab)
2. **About section**: Add description and tags:
   - Description: "Commercial solar lead generation platform for British Columbia"
   - Website: Your deployed app URL (if available)
   - Topics: `solar`, `british-columbia`, `lead-generation`, `typescript`, `react`, `ai`

3. **Pages** (if you want GitHub Pages):
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main
   - Folder: / (root)

## Your Repository URL

Once created, your repository will be available at:
**https://github.com/Deng1559/bc-commercial-solar-platform**

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Replit**: Import your GitHub repo to Replit for hosting
2. **Set up environment**: Add your database and API keys
3. **Share**: Your professional repository is ready to showcase
4. **Collaborate**: Others can now fork and contribute to your project

## Troubleshooting

**If files are too large:**
- Remove `node_modules` folder (it will be rebuilt with `npm install`)
- Remove `dist` folder (built files)
- The `.gitignore` file already excludes these

**If upload fails:**
- Try uploading in smaller batches
- Ensure file sizes are under GitHub's limits
- Check that file names don't contain special characters
